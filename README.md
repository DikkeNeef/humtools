Tools for extracting data from Humongous Entertainment Games
------------
NOTE: you need 2 displays, and for the editor you need a 1920x1080 screensize

Since the .HE0x-file data are way too big for my future project "porting these games to the web"  
These (future) tools will extract the following properties into a single json file for each scene.
